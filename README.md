# Shared Global Karapace Schema Registry Test

---
### Overview
- Deploys infrastructure via Terraform 
  - two Apache KafkaÂ® services and requisite dependencies
- Creates and configures (access, etc. for) the requisite integration-endpoint, proxy, etc.
- Configures a primary Apache Kafka and then accesses those resources from the secondary endoint via HAProxy
  - The queries to the secondary Apache Kafka services Karapace schema registry endpoint via the `test-schema-registry.sh` script are proxied to the primary Apache Kafka services schema registry--the logical flow is shown in below diagram:

##### Deploy the test infrasture and create/configure the integration endpoint
- Deploy all requisite infrastructure simply by executing the main `DEPLOY` script
  - `./bin/DEPLOY-terraform-infra.sh`
    - which deploys requisite infrastructure via Terraform, and then runs several dependency scripts:
      - `bin/create-endpoint-and-integration.sh`
      - `bin/test-schema-registry.sh`

- Once this main wrapper script is executed, all dependency scripts, etc. will be executed as well.
  - We can then validate on the "dependent" Kafka service's page in the Console (and in the API responses) will appear the Karapace Schema Registry section with its own URL and credentials. You can now send Karapace Schema Registry requests to the "dependent" Kafka service, they will be `proxied` to the "real/primary/global" Schema Registry URL.

- The test script `bin/test-schema-registry.sh` is idempotent, and can be expanded/enhanced, and called directly if desired.

---
##### Show any/all existing infra deployed via Terraform
- `./bin/show-all-terraform-infra.sh`

---
##### Destroy all test terraform infrastructure (Apache Kafka instances, services, etc.) and delete its test integration-endpoint
- `./bin/DESTROY-terraform-infra.sh`
